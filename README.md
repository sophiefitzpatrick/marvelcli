# marvelcli

A CLI wrapper for Marvelapp (https://marvelapp.com)

The wrapper will enable you to interact with your Marvel
account from the comfort of your command line.

## Getting started:

`pip install marvelapp-cli`

https://pypi.org/project/marvelapp-cli/

## Authing requests:

You will need an access token to use the CLI, generate a new one or find the one you already have set up here: https://marvelapp.com/oauth/devtoken

You can export your token by running this command from the same dir you installed the CLI:
`export MARVEL_CLI_TOKEN='your access token'`

The CLI will then automatically use this token for each command you run (so you don't have to auth each one individually).

Or you can wait until the CLI prompts you for your auth token, then we'll save it for you in the same manner.

## Example:

To invite users to your workspace:

	marvelcli invite-users-to-workspace --email "janis@bigbrotherandtheholdingcompany.com" --email "stevie@fleetwoodmac.com" --email "grace@jeffersonairplane.com"
